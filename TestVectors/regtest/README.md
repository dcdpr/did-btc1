# did:btc1 Regtest Test Vectors

This folder contains a set of test vectors for **did:btc1** identifiers registered on a local regtest network. The state of that network is contains in the `did-btc1-electrs.polar.zip` folder.

## Connecting to the regtest network

### Terminal 

1. First, extract the `did-btc1-electrs.polar.zip` folder somewhere.
2. Move into the extracted folder: `cd did-btc1-electrs.polar`
3. Start the containers: `docker-compose up`
4. Verify the network is running with electrs.
  a. Go to `http://localhost:3000/blocks` and a list of json objects representing bitcoin blocks should be returned.
  b. Run `curl localhost:3000/blocks` in a terminal

If you get `curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer` or cannot visit localhost:3000 in a browser, try the following debugging steps.

1. Ensure the containers are running (step 3 above)
2. Open a new terminal window
3. Determine the bitcoind container ID: `docker ps | awk -F '  ' '{ print $1, $2 }' | grep 'polar'` (or just `docker ps` and look for the CONTAINER ID of the polarlightning container)
4. Drop a shell into that bitcoind container: `docker exec -it <CONTAINER_ID> bash`
5. Once inside the bitcoind container, mine a block:
  ```sh
  bitcoin-cli \
    -regtest \
    -rpcuser=polaruser \
    -rpcpassword=polarpass \
    generatetoaddress 1 \
    $(bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=polaruser -rpcpassword=polarpass getnewaddress)
  ```
4. Wait 30s or so for it to finish syncing and retry step 4 above.

Alternatively, the zip file can be dragged into the [lighting polar](https://lightningpolar.com/) app, if it is installed. Then the network can be started through the apps interface. However, doing this may drop the electrs part of the docker file. If this happens, view the docker-compose file in the `did-btc1-electrs.polar.zip` folder and copy across into the polar docker compose. Polar networks can be found under `~/.polar/networks`.

## Running the test

Using a **did:btc1** Resolver, you should be able to resolve the test vectors under the `regtest` folder. At the moment, each test vectors is expected to succeed. 

You should configure your resolver to query the electrs API at `http://localhost:3000.

Each test vector is in a folder named after the method specific identifier of the vector. Each folder contains:

1. `did.txt` - The **did:btc1** identifier to be resolved
2. `resolutionOptions.json` - A resolution options object to be passed into the resolver. Typically contains necessary sidecar data.
3. `initialDidDoc.json` - The initial DID Document for the **did:btc1** identifier.
4. `intermediateDidDoc.json` - If the **did:btc1** identifier is external (starts with x1), then this is the intermediate DID document that was used to produce the method specific identifier.
5. `keys.json` - A set of hex encoded public and private keypairs used by the DID controller. These are mapped to an identified element of the DID document. E.g. a beacon service
6. `targetDidDocument.json` - The result you should get after resolving the identifier. TODO: Update this to resolutionResult.json
7. Additionally, there may be a set of folders labeled `blockXXX` where `XXX` is a number. This is the data relevant to an update the was broadcast in a beacon signal which your resolver should locate in the bitcoin block `XXX`. Each block folder contains:
  1. `updates.json` - a List of updates found in beacon signals at `blockXXX`. Typically one, but can be more.
  2. `canonicalUpdatePayload.txt` - The JCS canonicalization of the DID document being updated
  3. `documentHashHex.txt` - The hex represetnation of the hash of the update
  4. `contemporaryDidDocument.json` - The DID document after applying the updates in the `updates.json`

The contents of the TestVectors is a work in progress. The idea is that to run the test you need to take the `did.txt` and `resolutionOptions.txt` which should resolve to a `targetDidDocument.json` (resolutionResult actually). If you are not getting this, then you can use the additional information to debug and see where we have differences.
