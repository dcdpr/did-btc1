## Appendix - Optimized Sparse Merkle Tree Implementation

### Overview

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree):

> In cryptography and computer science, a hash tree or ::Merkle Tree:: is a tree in which every "leaf" node is labelled with the cryptographic hash of a data block, and every node that is not a leaf (called a branch, inner node, or inode) is labeled with the cryptographic hash of the labels of its child nodes. A hash tree allows efficient and secure verification of the contents of a large data structure. A hash tree is a generalization of a hash list and a hash chain.

```

These are the requirements for using ::Merkle Trees:: to signal commitments in ::BTC1 Beacons:::

* Each data block is either a ::BTC1 Update:: or null.
* No key may have more than one data block.
* The hash of a non-leaf node is the hash of the concatenation of its child nodes' hashes.
* The only thing published to Bitcoin is the top hash (the Merkle root).

The DID controller has to prove either inclusion or non-inclusion in the ::Beacon Signal::. To prove inclusion, the DID controller provides either the ::BTC1 Update:: (from which the verifier must calculate the hash) or the hash (which the verifier can use to retrieve the ::BTC1 Update:: from a ::CAS::); to prove non-inclusion, the DID controller provides the null value (from which the verifier must calculate the hash). In addition, the DID controller must provide the hashes of each peer in the tree (the Merkle proof) as the verifier walks up it to determine the top hash (which, in turn, must have been provided to the DID controller by the aggregator).

Let’s assume that the DID controller has been allocated position 13 (1101).

To prove that the DID is included in the signal, the DID controller provides the ::BTC1 Update:: to calculate *Hash 1101* and the values *Hash 1100*, *Hash 111*, *Hash 10*, and *Hash 0*. The verifier then calculates *Hash 110*, *Hash 11*, *Hash 1*, and *Top Hash*. If that last value matches the value in the signal, the verifier knows that the DID is included in the signal.

The logic is the same for non-inclusion, except that the DID controller provides the null value instead of the ::BTC1 Update:: to calculate *Hash 1101*.

In either case, the DID presentation would include something like the following:

```json
{
  "peers": [
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 1100 >>",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 111 >>",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 10 >>",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 0 >>"
  ]
}
```

This assumes that *hash(X + Y)* = *hash(Y + X)*, i.e., that the addition operation is commutative. If not, then the position of the peer node must be included:

```json
{
  "peers": [
    {
      "left": "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 1100 >>"
    },
    {
      "right": "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 111 >>"
    },
    {
      "left": "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 10 >>"
    },
    {
      "left": "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 0 >>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Attacks

#### Misrepresented Proof of Inclusion/Non-Inclusion

Let’s assume that a nefarious actor (NA) joined the cohort in the beginning and was allocated position 2 (0010). At some point in time, NA gains access to the cryptographic material and the entire DID history for the DID in position 13 (1101) belonging to a legitimate actor (LA). NA does not gain access to the cryptographic material LA uses to sign their part of the n-of-n Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR) Bitcoin address, which is unrelated to the DID. LA discovers the breach immediately and posts an update, rotating their keys or deactivating the DID.

NA makes a presentation with LA’s DID and, using the ::Sidecar:: method, provides all the legitimate DID updates except the most recent one. In its place, NA provides proof of inclusion (to change the DID document) or non-inclusion (to retain the prior version of the DID document), using the material provided by the aggregator for position 2 (0010), for which NA posted an update (for inclusion) or nothing (for non-inclusion). If the direction is not included, there is no way for the verifier to know that the path taken to the root is illegitimate, and it accepts the presentation by NA. If the direction is included, comparison to previous presentations would detect the breach by noting the changes in the direction, assuming that once allocated, the DID position is fixed.

To mitigate this attack, a DID’s position must be fixed deterministically and the hashing operation most not be commutative, i.e., *hash(X + Y)* ≠ *hash(Y + X)*. The following algorithm meets these requirements:

1. A DID’s position is the SHA256 hash of the DID.
2. The value at the DID’s position for the signal is the ::BTC1 Update Announcement:: for that DID (0 if null).
3. For any parent node:
    1. If the values of both child nodes are 0, the value of the parent node is 0.
    2. Otherwise, the value of the parent node is the hash of the concatenation of the 256-bit left child value and the 256-bit right child value.

The consequence of step 1 is that the ::Merkle Tree:: has up to 2<sup>256</sup> leaves, 2<sup>256</sup>-1 nodes, and a depth of 256+1=257. This is mitigated by step 3i, which limits the tree size to only those branches where at least one leaf has a non-null data block. The presentation of the peer hashes doesn't require direction, as the sequence of directions is determined by the DID's position.

#### Information Leakage

To prove inclusion or non-inclusion, it is necessary to present a list of peer hashes from bottom to top. A verifier then takes the hash of the ::BTC1 Update:: (inclusion) or the hash of null (non-inclusion) and applies the algorithm above to walk up to the root. Most of the peer hashes will be zero.

The list of peer hashes must be provided by the aggregator to the DID controller. Changes in the values (from zero to non-zero or from non-zero to zero) indicate frequency of changes to other DIDs in the peer branch. Furthermore, assuming that a verifier has a DID from a past presentation with the same aggregator Beacon address:

* a zero value in a node that encompasses the hash value of the DID is definitive proof that the DID document has not been updated; and
* a non-zero value in a node that encompasses the hash value of the DID is statistically significant proof that the DID document has been updated.

Let's assume that:

* positions 0 (0000), 2 (0010), 5 (0101), 9 (1001), 13 (1101), and 14 (1110) have DIDs associated with them;
* a signal includes updates for DIDs 2, 9, and 13; and
* a verifier presented with DID 13 also knows, through prior presentations, about DIDs 5 and 14, but not about DIDs 0, 2, and 9.

The hash tree for the signal looks like this:

```

The presentation to the verifier for DID 13 includes the following:

```json
{
  "peers": [
    "0000...0000",
    "0000...0000",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 10 >>",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 0 >>"
  ]
}
```

From this, the verifier can infer that:

* position 12 (1100) is not allocated or has been allocated to an unknown DID that hasn't been updated;
* the DID at position 14 (1110) has not been updated;
* position 15 (1111) is not allocated or has been allocated to an unknown DID that hasn't been updated;
* one or more unknown DIDs at positions 8-11 (1000-1011) have been updated; and
* the DID at position 5 (0101) may have been updated (probability ≥ 1/8).

To mitigate this, inclusion and non-inclusion should be indistinguishable, i.e., there should not be a reserved value of 0 indicating a null payload. It is still necessary to identify empty branches (otherwise the hash calculation time becomes impossibly large), so the reserved value of 0 is retained for that purpose. The following (revised) algorithm meets these requirements:

* A DID’s position is the SHA256 hash of the DID.
* A signal- and DID-specific 256-bit nonce shall be generated by the DID controller, regardless of update or non-update status.
* The value at the DID’s position for the signal is the nonce xored with the hash of the ::BTC1 Update:: for that signal (0 if null).
    * If the DID controller is responsible for providing the value, the nature of the signal (update or non-update) is hidden from the aggregator.
* The value of the parent node is the hash of the concatenation of the 256-bit left child value (0 if the left branch is empty) and the 256-bit right child value (0 if the right branch is empty).
    * One or both of the left and right branches is non-empty.

Using the example above, the hash tree for the signal looks like this:

    Hash0010 --> DataBlock0010[("Data Block 0010")]:::dataBlock
    Hash1001 --> DataBlock1001[("Data Block 1001")]:::dataBlock
    Hash1101 --> DataBlock1101[("Data Block 1101")]:::dataBlock
```

Every DID is included, so there is no longer a proof of non-inclusion. Instead, what's being proved is the presence or absence of an update, where the absence of an update is a null document. To prove presence or absence of an update, the DID controller presents the nonce, the ::BTC1 Update:: or null, and the list of peer hashes from bottom to top.

Now, the presentation to the verifier for DID 13 includes the following:

```json
{
  "nonce": "<< Hexadecimal of Nonce 1101 >>",
  "peers": [
    "0000...0000",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 111 >>",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 10 >>",
    "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 0 >>"
  ]
}
```

From this, the verifier can infer only that position 12 (1100) is not allocated. Having the nonce vary per signal ensures that the hash of the null value varies and so can't be tested for across signals. Having the nonce vary per DID ensures that the verifier can't test for non-update of other known DIDs. Peer hashes that are zero will always be zero and those that are non-zero will always be non-zero.

### Optimization

The tree can be further optimized as outlined in [The Libra Blockchain](https://diem-developers-components.netlify.app/papers/the-diem-blockchain/2020-05-26.pdf). The first optimization collapses empty nodes into a fixed value; this is already defined above where the hash of an empty node is zero. The second optimization is to replace subtrees containing exactly one leaf with a single node. This reduces the tree size significantly to a depth of approximately *log2(n)*, where *n* is the number of leaves.

Doing this violates the requirement that the starting point be deterministic; the verifier would have to know every occupied index to infer the starting point for the DID of interest. It also requires that non-updates be included, as it would otherwise be impossible to prove non-inclusion, and the nonce is still required so that updates are indistinguishable from non-updates.

Mitigating the deterministic index issue is accomplished by setting the value to the hash of index concatenated with the the hash value provided by the DID controller. The end result is this (note that the positions of nodes Hash1001 and Hash11 are reversed due to the Mermaid layout algorithm):

Now, the presentation to the verifier for DID 13 includes the following:

```json
{
  "nonce": "<< Hexadecimal of Nonce 1101 >>",
  "peers": [
    {
      "right": "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 1110 >>"
    },
    {
      "left": "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 1001 >>"
    },
    {
      "left": "<< Hexadecimal of Hash 0 >>"
    }
  ]
}
```

The only thing the verifier can infer from any presentation is the depth of the tree and therefore an estimate of the number of DIDs using the Beacon.
