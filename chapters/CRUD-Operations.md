## CRUD Operations

This section defines the Create, Read, Update, and Deactivate (CRUD) operations
for the **did:btc1** method.

### Create

A **did:btc1** identifier and associated DID document can either be created
deterministically from a cryptographic seed, or it can be created from an arbitrary
genesis intermediate DID document representation. In both cases, DID creation can
be undertaken in an offline manner, i.e., the DID controller does not need to
interact with the Bitcoin network to create their DID.

#### Deterministic Key-based Creation

For deterministic creation, the **did:btc1** identifier encodes a secp256k1 public key.
The key is then used to deterministically generate the initial DID document.

The algorithm takes in `pubKeyBytes`, a compressed SEC encoded secp256k1
public key and optional `version` and `network` values. The algorithm returns a
**did:btc1** identifier and corresponding initial DID document.

1. Set `idType` to "key".
1. Set `version` to `1`.
1. Set `network` to the desired network.
1. Set `genesisBytes` to `pubKeyBytes`.
1. Pass `idType`, `version`, `network`, and `genesisBytes` to the [did:btc1
   Identifier Encoding](#didbtc1-identifier-encoding) algorithm, retrieving
   `id`.
1. Set `did` to `id`.
1. Set `initialDocument` to the result of passing `did` into the [Read] algorithm.
1. Return `did` and `initialDocument`.

#### External Initial Document Creation

It is possible to create a **did:btc1** from some initiating arbitrary DID document.
This allows for more complex initial DID documents, including the ability to include
Service Endpoints and ::Beacons:: that support aggregation.

The algorithm takes in an `intermediateDocument` struct, an OPTIONAL `version`,
and an OPTIONAL `network`. The `intermediateDocument` MUST be a valid DID document
except all places where the DID document requires the use of the identifier
(e.g., the id field), this identifier MUST be the placeholder value
`did:btc1:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
The DID document SHOULD include at least one verificationMethod and service of
the type SingletonBeacon.

1. Set `idType` to "external".
1. Set `version` to `1`.
1. Set `network` to the desired network.
1. Set `genesisBytes` to the result of passing `intermediateDocument` into the
   [JSON Canonicalization and Hash] algorithm.
1. Pass `idType`, `version`, `network`, and `genesisBytes` to the [did:btc1
   Identifier Encoding](#didbtc1-identifier-encoding) algorithm, retrieving
   `id`.
1. Set `did` to `id`.
1. Set `initialDocument` to a copy of the `intermediateDocument`.
1. Replace all `did:btc1:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`
   values in the `initialDocument` with the `did`.
1. Optionally store `canonicalBytes` on a ::Content Addressable Storage:: (CAS)
   system like IPFS. If doing so, implementations MUST use ::CIDs:: generated following
   the IPFS v1 algorithm.
1. Return `did` and `initialDocument`.

### Read

The read operation is executed by a resolver after a resolution request identifying
a specific **did:btc1** `identifier` is received from a client at ::Resolution Time::.
The request MAY contain a `resolutionOptions` object containing additional information
to be used in resolution. The resolver then attempts to resolve the DID document
of the `identifier` at a specific ::Target Time::. The ::Target Time:: is either provided
in `resolutionOptions` or is set to the ::Resolution Time:: of the request.

To do so it executes the following algorithm:

1. Pass `identifier` to the [did:btc1 Identifier Decoding](#didbtc1-identifier-decoding)
   algorithm, retrieving `idType`, `version`, `network`, and `genesisBytes`.
1. Set `identifierComponents` to a map of `idType`, `version`, `network`, and `genesisBytes`.
1. Set `initialDocument` to the result of running the algorithm in
   [Resolve Initial Document] passing in the `identifier`, `identifierComponents`
   and `resolutionOptions`.
1. Set `targetDocument` to the result of running the algorithm in
   [Resolve Target Document] passing in `initialDocument` and `resolutionOptions`.
1. Return `targetDocument`.

#### Resolve Initial Document

This algorithm specifies how to resolve an initial DID document and validate
it against the `identifier` for a specific **did:btc1**. The algorithm takes as
inputs a **did:btc1** `identifier`, `identifierComponents` object and a
`resolutionsOptions` object. This algorithm returns a valid `initialDocument`
for that identifier.

1. If `identifierComponents.idType` value is "key", then set the `initialDocument`
   to the result of running the algorithm in
   [Deterministically Generate Initial DID Document] passing in the `identifier`
   and `identifierComponents` values.
1. Else If `identifierComponents.idType` value is "external", then set the
   `initialDocument` to the result of running [External Resolution] passing in
   the `identifier`, `identifierComponents` and `resolutionOptions` values.
1. Else MUST raise `invalidHRPValue` error.
1. Return `initialDocument`.

##### Deterministically Generate Initial DID Document

This algorithm deterministically generates an initial DID Document from a secp256k1
public key.
It takes in a **did:btc1** `identifier` and an `identifierComponents` object and
returns an `initialDocument`.

    1. Initialize `verificationMethod` to an empty object.
    1. Set `verificationMethod.id` to `{identifier}#initialKey`.
    1. Set `verificationMethod.type` to "Multikey".

    1. Set `verificationMethod.publicKeyMultibase` to the result of the TODO:
       Multikey encoding algorithm passing in `keyBytes`.

   `verificationMethod`.
1. Initialize a `tempArray` variable to an array with the single element
   `verificationMethod.id`.
1. Set the `authentication`, `assertionMethod`, `capabilityInvocation`, and the
   `capabilityDelegation` properties in `initialDocument` to a copy of the `tempArray`
   variable.
1. Set the `initialDocument.services` property in `initialDocument` to the
   result of passing the `identifier`, `keyBytes` and `identifierComponents.network` to the
   [Deterministically Generate Beacon Services] algorithm.
1. Return `initialDocument`.

###### Deterministically Generate Beacon Services

This algorithm deterministically generates three ::Beacons:: from the single
`keyBytes` value used to generate the deterministic **did:btc1**, one for each
of the following three Bitcoin address types for the Bitcoin `network` specified
by the DID: Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (P2PKH), Pay-to-Witness-Public-Key-Hash (P2WPKH),
and Pay-to-Taproot (P2TR). Spends from these three addresses can be produced only
through signatures from the `keyBytes`'s associated private key.
Each ::Beacon:: is of the type SingletonBeacon. The algorithm returns a `services` array.

1. Initialize a `services` variable to an empty array.
1. Set `serviceId` to `{identifier}#initialP2PKH`.
1. Set `beaconAddress` to the result of generating a Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash Bitcoin
   address from the `keyBytes` for the appropriate `network`.

1. Push `p2trBeacon` to `services`.
1. Return the `services` array.

##### External Resolution

This algorithm externally retrieves an `intermediateDocumentRepresentation`,
either by retrieving it from ::Content Addressable Storage:: (CAS) or from the
::Sidecar Data:: provided as part of the resolution request. The algorithm
takes in a **did:btc1** `identifier`, an `identifierComponents` object and a
`resolutionOptions` object.
It returns an `initialDocument`, which is a conformant DID document validated
against the `identifier`.

1. If `resolutionOptions.sidecarData.initialDocument` is not null, set
   `initialDocument` to the result of passing `identifier`, `identifierComponents`,
   and `resolutionOptions.sidecarData.initialDocument` into algorithm

1. Validate `initialDocument` is a conformant DID document according to the
   DID Core 1.1 specification. Else MUST raise `invalidDidDocument` error.
1. Return `initialDocument`.

###### Sidecar Initial Document Validation

This algorithm validates an `initialDocument` against its `identifier`,
by first constructing the `intermediateDocumentRepresentation` and verifying
the hash of this document matches the bytes encoded within the `identifier`.
The algorithm takes in a **did:btc1** `identifier`, `identifierComponents`
and an `initialDocument`. The algorithm returns the `initialDocument` if validated,
otherwise it throws an error.

1. Set `intermediateDocumentRepresentation` to a copy of the `initialDocument`.
1. Find and replace all values of `identifier` contained within the
   `intermediateDocumentRepresentation` with the string
   (`did:btc1:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`).

1. If `hashBytes` does not equal `identifierComponents.genesisBytes` MUST throw an `invalidDid` error.
1. Return `initialDocument`.

###### CAS Retrieval

This algorithm attempts to retrieve an `initialDocument` from a ::Content
Addressable Storage:: (CAS) system by converting the bytes in the `identifier`
into a ::Content Identifier:: (CID). The algorithm takes in an `identifier` and an
`identifierComponents` object and returns an `initialDocument`.

Bitcoin blockchain to identify ::Beacon Signals:: that announce ::DID Update Payloads::
applicable to the **did:btc1** identifier being resolved.

identifier being resolved as verified by the [Resolve Initial Document] algorithm.
A DID Core conformant DID document.
- `resolutionOptions`: A set of optional parameters passed into the resolve function
of the DID resolver.
- `network`: The Bitcoin network of the **did:btc1** identifier.


The algorithm returns `targetDocument`, a DID Core conformant DID document or throws an error.

##### Traverse Blockchain History

This algorithm traverses this history of the Bitcoin blockchain, starting from the block 
with the blockheight equal to `contemporaryBlockheight`, to find `beaconSignals` 
emitted by ::Beacons:: specified within the `contemporaryDIDDocument`. 
Each `beaconSignal` is processed to retrieve a ::DID Update Payload:: defining updates to 
the DID document. Each update is applied to the document and duplicates are ignored. The algorithm 
recursively executes until either a `targetVersionId` for the DID document is reached, or the 
blockchain history passes the supplied `targetTime`. At this point the current `contemporaryDIDDocument`
is returned.

The algorithm takes the following inputs:

- `contemporaryDIDDocument`: The DID document for the **did:btc1** identifier 
   being resolved that is current at the blockheight of the `contemporaryBlockheight`. 
   A DID Core conformant DID document.

   to a struct containing ::Sidecar Data:: for that signal provided as part of the
   resolutionOptions. This struct contains the following properties:
   - `updatePayload`: A ::DID Update Payload:: which should match the update announced
      by the ::Beacon Signal::. In the case of a ::SMT:: proof of non-inclusion no
      DID Update Payload may be provided.
   - `proofs`: A ::Sparse Merkle Tree:: proof that the provided `updatePayload` value is
      the value at the leaf indexed by the **did:btc1** being resolved. TODO: What exactly this
      structure is needs to be defined.

### Update

An update to a **did:btc1** document is an invoked capability using the ZCAP-LD
data format, signed by a verificationMethod that has the authority to make the
update as specified in the previous DID document. Capability invocations for
updates MUST be authorized using Data Integrity following the bip340-jcs-2025
cryptosuite with a proofPurpose of `capabilityInvocation`.

This algorithm takes as inputs a `btc1Identifier`, `sourceDocument`,
`sourceVersionId`, `documentPatch`, a `verificationMethodId`, and an array
of `beaconIds`. The `sourceDocument` is the DID document being updated. The
`documentPatch` is a JSON Patch object containing a set of transformations to
be applied to the `sourceDocument`. The result of these transformations MUST
produce a DID document conformant to the DID Core specification. The
`verificationMethodId` is an identifier for a verificationMethod within the
`sourceDocument`. The verificationMethod identified MUST be a BIP340
Multikey. The `beaconIds` MUST identify service endpoints with one of the
three ::Beacon Types:: `SingletonBeacon`, `CIDAggregateBeacon`, and

1. Set `verificationMethod` to the result of retrieving the verificationMethod from
   `sourceDocument` using the `verificationMethodId`.
1. Validate the `verificationMethod` is a BIP340 Multikey:
    1. `verificationMethod.type` == `Multikey`
    1. `verificationMethod.publicKeyMultibase[4]` == `z66P`
1. Set `didUpdateInvocation` to the result of passing `btc1Identifier`,
   `unsignedUpdate` as `didUpdatePayload, `and `verificationMethod` to the
   [Invoke DID Update Payload] algorithm.
1. Set `signalsMetadata` to the result of passing `btc1Identifier`, `sourceDocument`, 
   `beaconIds` and `didUpdateInvocation` to the [Announce DID Update] algorithm.
1. Return `signalsMetadata`. It is up to implementations to ensure that the
   `signalsMetadata` is persisted.

#### Construct DID Update Payload

This algorithm takes in a `btc1Identifier`, `sourceDocument`, `sourceVersionId`,
and `documentPatch` objects. It applies the `documentPatch` to the `sourceDocument`
and verifies the resulting `targetDocument` is a conformant DID document. Then
it constructs and returns an unsigned ::DID Update Payload::.

1. Check that `sourceDocument.id` equals `btc1Identifier` else MUST raise
   `invalidDidUpdate` error.
1. Initialize `didUpdatePayload` to an empty object.
1. Set `didUpdatePayload.@context` to the following list // TODO: Need to add btc1 context.
   `["https://w3id.org/zcap/v1", "https://w3id.org/security/data-integrity/v2", 
   "https://w3id.org/json-ld-patch/v1"]`
1. Set `didUpdatePayload.patch` to `documentPatch`.
1. Set `targetDocument` to the result of applying the `documentPatch` to the
   `sourceDocument`, following the JSON Patch specification.
1. Validate `targetDocument` is a conformant DID document, else MUST raise
   `invalidDidUpdate` error.
1. Set `sourceHashBytes` to the result of passing `sourceDocument` into
   the [JSON Canonicalization and Hash] algorithm.
1. Set `didUpdatePayload.sourceHash` to the base58-btc Multibase encoding
   of `sourceHashBytes`. // Question: is base58btc the correct encoding scheme?
1. Set `targetHashBytes` to the result of passing `targetDocument` into
   the [JSON Canonicalization and Hash] algorithm.
1. Set `didUpdatePayload.targetHash` to the base58-btc Multibase encoding
   of `targetHashBytes`.
1. Set `didUpdatePayload.targetVersionId` to `sourceVersionId + 1`
1. Return `didUpdatePayload`.

#### Invoke DID Update Payload

This algorithm takes in a `btc1Identifier`, an unsigned `didUpdatePayload`, and a
`verificationMethod`. The algorithm retrieves the `privateKeyBytes` for the
`verificationMethod` and adds a capability invocation in the form of a Data
Integrity proof following the Authorization Capabilities (ZCAP-LD) and
VC Data Integrity specifications.

The algorithm returns the invoked ::DID Update Payload::.

1. Set `privateKeyBytes` to the result of retrieving the private key bytes
   associated with the `verificationMethod` value. How this is achieved is left to
   the implementation.
1. Set `rootCapability` to the result of passing `btc1Identifier` into the
   [Derive Root Capability from **did:btc1** Identifier] algorithm.
1. Initialize `proofOptions` to an empty object.
1. Set `proofOptions.type` to `DataIntegrityProof`.
1. Set `proofOptions.cryptosuite` to `bip340-jcs-2025`.
1. Set `proofOptions.verificationMethod` to `verificationMethod.id`.
1. Set `proofOptions.proofPurpose` to `capabilityInvocation`.
1. Set `proofOptions.capability` to `rootCapability.id`.
1. Set `proofOptions.capabilityAction` to `Write`. // Wonder if we actually need this.
   Aren't we always writing.
1. Set `cryptosuite` to the result of executing the Cryptosuite Instantiation
   algorithm from the [BIP340 Data Integrity specification](https://dcdpr.github.io/data-integrity-schnorr-secp256k1) passing in
   `proofOptions`.
1. // TODO: need to set up the proof instantiation such that it can resolve
   / dereference the root capability. This is deterministic from the DID.
1. Set `didUpdateInvocation` to the result of executing the
   [Add Proof](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-integrity/#add-proof)
   algorithm from VC Data Integrity passing `didUpdatePayload` as the input document,
   `cryptosuite`, and the set of `proofOptions`.
1. Return `didUpdateInvocation`.

#### Announce DID Update

This algorithm takes in a `btc1Identifier`, `sourceDocument`, an array of `beaconIds`, 
and a `didUpdateInvocation`. It retrieves `beaconServices` from the `sourceDocument`
and calls the Broadcast DID Update algorithm corresponding to the type of
the ::Beacon::. The algorithm returns an array of `signalsMetadata`, containing the
necessary data to validate the ::Beacon Signal:: against the `didUpdateInvocation`.

1. Set `beaconServices` to an empty array.
1. Set `signalMetadata` to an empty array.
1. For `beaconId` in `beaconIds`:
   1. Find `beaconService` in `sourceDocument.service` with an `id` property
    equal to `beaconId`.
   1. If no `beaconService` MUST throw `beaconNotFound` error.
   1. Push `beaconService` to `beaconServices`.
1. For `beaconService` in `beaconServices`:
   1. Set `signalMetadata` to null.
   1. If `beaconService.type` == `SingletonBeacon`:
      1. Set `signalMetadata` to the result of
        passing `beaconService` and `didUpdateInvocation` to the
        [Broadcast Singleton Beacon Signal] algorithm.
   1. Else If `beaconService.type` == `CIDAggregateBeacon`:
      1. Set `signalMetadata` to the result of
        passing `btc1Identifier`, `beaconService` and `didUpdateInvocation` to the
        [Broadcast CIDAggregate Beacon Signal] algorithm.
   1. Else If `beaconService.type` == `SMTAggregateBeacon`:
      1. Set `signalMetadata` to the result of
        passing `btc1Identifier`, `beaconService` and `didUpdateInvocation` to the
        [Broadcast SMTAggregate Beacon Signal] algorithm.
   1. Else:
      1. MUST throw `invalidBeacon` error.
  1. Merge `signalMetadata` into `signalsMetadata`.

1. Return `signalsMetadata`.



### Deactivate

To deactivate a **did:btc1**, the DID controller MUST add the property `deactivated`
with the value `true` on the DID document. To do this, the DID controller constructs
a valid ::DID Update Payload:: with a JSON patch that adds this property and announces
the payload through a ::Beacon:: in their current DID document following the algorithm
in [Update]. Once a **did:btc1** has been deactivated this
state is considered permanent and resolution MUST terminate.
